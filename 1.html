    						<h3>We live in a society where many different people exist and each person is special in their own way. They vary in things like skin color, culture, religion, and social class, which can lead to different social groups based on these factors. Some of these people are Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians and others. When people from various religious backgrounds live together peacefully, happily and with respect for each other's religions, it shows the idea of secularism.</h3>

				              <h2>In some countries like the United States, France, Turkey, India, Mexico, South Korea, and others, the government doesn't promote or favor any specific religion as its official one. Instead, all religions are treated equally, and no particular religion is given special preference or official status.</h2>

                            <h3>India gained independence from British rule on August 15, 1947. Secularism is an essential principle that was included in the Indian constitution. Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, played a significant role in promoting and establishing secular values in the country's history.

                                The Forty-second Amendment to the Constitution of India, passed in 1976, further emphasized India's secular identity. The Preamble of the Constitution explicitly declares India as a secular nation. According to the Constitution, India does not have an official state religion. Additionally, schools that are fully owned by the state are not allowed to promote religious teachings (as stated in Article 28), and taxpayer funds cannot be used to support any specific religion (as stated in Article 27). These constitutional provisions demonstrate India's commitment to maintaining a secular society.</h3>

                            <h3>According to P.B. Gajendragarkar, a former Chief Justice of India, secularism is defined as follows: "The state does not owe loyalty to any particular religion. As such, it is not irreligious or anti-religious. It gives equal freedom to all religions."</h3>
